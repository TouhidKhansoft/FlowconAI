# ============================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ============================================
# 1. API routes only work when deployed to Vercel (not in local dev)
# 2. For local development, run `yarn dev` - chatbot UI will be visible but non-functional
# 3. To test with working API: deploy with `vercel --prod`
# 4. NEVER commit .env.local to version control
# 5. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard for production
