# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FlowConAI landing page - a responsive React-based website built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. Originally generated by Anima design-to-code platform and heavily customized.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development (runs on port 5173, may auto-increment if in use)
yarn run dev

# Production build (outputs to /dist)
yarn build

# Component development with Storybook
yarn storybook
yarn build-storybook
```

**Important**: This project uses Yarn as the package manager. Use `yarn` instead of `npm` for all commands.

## Architecture & Key Files

### Core Structure
- **Entry Point**: `/index.html` → `/src/index.jsx` → `/src/screens/Desktop/Desktop.jsx`
- **Main Component**: `Desktop.jsx` - Contains the entire landing page as a single component with all sections
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom variables defined in `/tailwind.css`

### Design System
- **Colors**: Custom CSS variables in `tailwind.css` (lines 19-38)
  - Primary: `#4361EE` (blue)
  - Teal accent: `#00BFA5` (used in backgrounds)
  - Dark backgrounds: `#0A0E27` to `#101331`
- **Font**: Poppins (loaded via Google Fonts)
- **Gradients**: Button gradients use `from-[#3B82F6] to-[#07214C]`

### Key Customizations Made
1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu
2. **Background Effects**: Top-right gradient blur with visual filters
3. **Glassmorphic Elements**: Cards and CTA section with backdrop blur
4. **Button Hover States**: Enhanced with scale, brightness, and glow effects

### Component Sections (in order)
1. Navigation with mobile menu
2. Hero section with search bar
3. Expertise/Services grid
4. Features section with large cards
5. About section
6. Blog grid
7. FAQ accordion
8. CTA section with special gradient border
9. Footer

## Development Notes

- **Port Conflicts**: Dev server searches for available ports starting from 5173
- **Static Assets**: Images stored in `/static/img/`
- **No Git Repo**: Project is not yet initialized with git
- **State Management**: Simple useState hooks, no complex state library

## Recent Design Decisions

- Removed circular blur effects from footer area
- CTA section has unique gradient background with visible border
- Buttons have blue gradient with enhanced hover effects
- "AI Age" text is white, not gradient
- Background uses teal/blue blur orbs matching flowconai-landing project
