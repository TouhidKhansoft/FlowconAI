# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FlowConAI landing page - a responsive React-based website built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. Originally generated by Anima design-to-code platform and heavily customized.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development (runs on port 5173)
yarn run dev

# Production build (outputs to /dist)
yarn build

# Component development with Storybook
yarn storybook
yarn build-storybook
```

**Important**: This project uses Yarn as the package manager. Use `yarn` instead of `npm` for all commands.

## Chatbot Setup (Client-Side Only)

**This project now uses Google Gemini AI directly in the browser - NO VERCEL NEEDED!**

1. **Get API Key**: Get your Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. **Set Environment Variable**: Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Run Locally**: `yarn dev` - The chatbot works immediately!

⚠️ **Security Warning**: The API key is exposed to the browser. This setup is for demos/personal projects only. For production, use server-side API routes.

## Architecture & Key Files

### Core Structure
- **Entry Point**: `/index.html` → `/src/index.jsx` → `/src/screens/Desktop/Desktop.jsx`
- **Main Component**: `Desktop.jsx` - Contains the entire landing page as a single component with all sections
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom variables defined in `/tailwind.css`

### Design System
- **Colors**: Custom CSS variables in `tailwind.css` (lines 19-38)
  - Primary: `#4361EE` (blue)
  - Teal accent: `#00BFA5` (used in backgrounds)
  - Dark backgrounds: `#0A0E27` to `#101331`
- **Font**: Poppins (loaded via Google Fonts)
- **Gradients**: Button gradients use `from-[#3B82F6] to-[#07214C]`

### Key Customizations Made
1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu
2. **Background Effects**: Top-right gradient blur with visual filters
3. **Glassmorphic Elements**: Cards and CTA section with backdrop blur
4. **Button Hover States**: Enhanced with scale, brightness, and glow effects

### Component Sections (in order)
1. Navigation with mobile menu
2. Hero section with search bar
3. Expertise/Services grid
4. Features section with large cards
5. About section
6. Blog grid
7. FAQ accordion
8. CTA section with special gradient border
9. Footer

## AI Chatbot Feature

- **Technology**: Assistant UI + Google Generative AI SDK (Gemini)
- **Architecture**: Client-side only - no API routes needed!
- **Q&A Patterns**: Predefined responses in `/src/lib/qa-patterns.js`
- **Runtime**: Custom Gemini integration in `/src/hooks/useGeminiRuntime.js`
- **Components**: Located in `/src/components/Chatbot/`
- **Environment**: Requires `VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`

## Development Notes

- **Port Conflicts**: Dev server searches for available ports starting from 5173
- **Static Assets**: Images stored in `/static/img/`
- **State Management**: Simple useState hooks, no complex state library
- **Chatbot**: Works immediately in local development with `yarn dev`

## Recent Design Decisions

- Removed circular blur effects from footer area
- CTA section has unique gradient background with visible border
- Buttons have blue gradient with enhanced hover effects
- "AI Age" text is white, not gradient
- Background uses teal/blue blur orbs matching flowconai-landing project
